<title>Enhanced Features for Teaching</title>
<section id="id11012388">
<title>Overview</title>
<para id="id11012422">Multisim is used in colleges and universities
around the globe. It has become an essential academic tool.
Academic features available in Multisim provide students with
intuitive methods for easily exploring circuit theory.</para>
<para id="id10876501">Because National Instruments products can be
applied at the introductory, advanced and professional levels,
studentsâ€™ proficiency with the software will naturally grow over
time, allowing them to focus on tackling increasingly complex
content and projects, not on learning new tools over and over as
their needs increase.</para>

<section id="id10874832">
<title>3D Virtual Components</title>
<para id="id10874859">Multisim includes a set of components
specifically designed for students with little to no experience
working with parts in real life. When placed on the schematic,
these 3D virtual components appear exactly as they look in the real
world. These components are available in the Basic group of the
Master Database, under the 3D_VIRTUAL family.</para>

<section id="id10875625">
<title>Animated Components</title>
<para id="id10875652">Animated components provide students with
visual feedback on circuit operation during simulation. Examples of
animated components include LEDs, 7-Segment displays, and other
interactive components such as switches and potentiometers.
Animated components are located throughout Multisim's
databases.</para>
</section>
<section id="id10875676">
<title>Rated Components</title>
<para id="id11012516">Rated Componentshave tolerances just like
real-world parts. Users can control the tolerance level by editing
the part properties. If the power being dissipated by a virtual
rated resistor is above the threshold, the resistor will "explode"
on the schematic, and act as an open circuit. Rated
Virtualcomponents can be found in the RATED_VIRTUAL family of the
Basic group in the Master Database.</para>
</section>
<section id="id11290132">
<title>3D Virtual Breadboard</title>
<para id="id11012679">Multisim also includes a 3D Virtual
Breadboard. The breadboard can be used to teach students important
prototyping techniques. Nets and components will turn green on the
schematic when their corresponding breadboard elements have been
correctly wired. The breadboard also includes a Design Rules Check
(DRC) and Connectivity Check.</para>

<section id="id11011865">
<title>3D Virtual ELVIS</title>
<para id="id11011887">In addition to the standard 3D Virtual
Breadboard, students also have the option to create NI ELVIS
schematics, which will have a corresponding 3D ELVIS
representation. The virtual instruments included with NI ELVIS such
as the function generator, oscilloscope, and variable power
supplies have also been modeled. To create an NI ELVIS schematic,
click File/New/ELVIS Schematic.</para>
<para id="id11011891">To access the ELVIS virtual instruments,
double-click on the terminals corresponding to the desired
instrument.</para>

<title>Troubleshooting</title>
<section id="id11266104">
<title>Circuit Faults</title>
<para id="id11266117">Instructors have the ability to insert faults
into schematics, and have students hone their troubleshooting
skills by trying to find the faults. The injected faults can be
hidden to force students to apply fundamental techniques of
troubleshooting. To add a fault into a component, double-click on
the component, and select the Faults tab.</para>
<para id="id11266142">Faults include open circuits on a particular
terminal, short circuits between two pins of a component, and
resistive losses measured in Ohms.</para>

<section id="id11266250">
<title>Black Boxes</title>
<para id="id11266263">Instructors can also use subcircuits as black
boxes, and engage students in more sophisticated circuit analysis
techniques. To create a black box problem, use the information in
Section I on creating subcircuits. Note:Hierarchical blocks should
not be used as black boxes because the internal circuitry is stored
in a separate file, which students would be able to view.</para>
</section>
<section id="id11011559">
<title>Circuit Restrictions</title>
<para id="id11011573">Circuit restrictions play a very important
role when creating black box problems, or inserting circuit faults.
Restrictions allow instructors to prevent students from seeing
subcircuits, hide the faults, and limit the number or available
components and instruments. In this manner, as an example, it is
possible to force students to use an oscilloscope to make gain
measurements when determining the bandwidths of filters, as a bode
plotter or AC analysis may not always be available.</para>
<para id="id11011799">Global and circuit restrictions are available
under the Options menu. Restrictions are locked by password.</para>
